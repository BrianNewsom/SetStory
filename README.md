## Description
The artist lineup is a music festivals holy grail of marketing; it’s where tens of thousands are spent to lose or
turn a profit on millions.

Yet music festival owners & promoters do not have an objective way of valuing a lineup: the question is simple:
“Will this music festival be successful based on it’s lineup?”

SetStory is a music festival and lineup analytics platform that measures the financial viability of a lineup by
tracking and analyzing each artists past performances.

SetStory was developed for the 2015 South By Southwest Music Hackathon Championship.
